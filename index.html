                <h4>Lou Sacco</h4>
                <p><span>Early Beginnings in Technology</span><br>
                    My journey in technology began at 13, programming games on a Commodore 64, sparking a lifelong passion for building and problem-solving. After earning my engineering degree, I joined EDS, where I completed their rigorous Systems Engineering Development program before pursuing my masterâs in Computer Science at the University of Michigan.
                </p>
                <p><span>Career Growth and Industry Experience</span><br>
                    A chance experience at an IBM conference brought me to San Diego, where I eventually moved and built my career working with startups and Fortune 500 companies like Qualcomm and Illumina. Iâve led teams, navigated digital transformations, and worked on groundbreaking projects, but what I love most is the process of solving complex challenges and bringing ideas to life.
                </p>
                <p><span>Innovating in Healthcare Technology</span><br>
                    Most recently, as CTO of DaisyHealth, I helped create a SaaS platform that improves healthcare access through telemedicine and AI-driven solutions for a fraction of the cost to underserved communities. Along the way, Iâve stayed engaged with the tech community through 7CTOs San Diego and the AWS CTO Fellowship, where I connect with peers, mentor emerging leaders, and share insights on technology and leadership.
                </p>
                <p><span>Passion for Building and Innovation</span><br>
                    At my core, Iâm a builder &mdash; of technology, of teams, and of strategies that drive real impact. I thrive on collaborating with innovative minds, tackling ambitious projects, and helping companies navigate the ever-evolving technology landscape.

        <p>I have had the pleasure of working with Lou over a four-year period. Lou has a very deep technical software development and devops knowledge which he has used to architect and deliver some innovative solutions. Throughout the four years, Lou took on more scope and expanded his leadership knowledge beyond software development to enterprise content management, collaboration, productivity, and e-discovery, where he was intuitive and very successful. He also has a great ability to solve complex problems and provide great guidance to his team. Lou is very collaborative and a great team player. He listens to his customers well and exceeds customers' expectations.</p>

                <p>Lou is one of the most talented developers I've had the chance to work with. He is constantly striving to deliver immense customer value through the innovative use of modern and leading edge technologies. Lou often looks for and implements very efficient and technology forward solutions to business challenges and is never afraid to take calculated risks. I had the opportunity to work with Lou in a variety of facets from a trusted development partner, to a fellow leader in the organization. In both areas I found Lou to excel both technically and professionally. Lou is well regarded as a leader both amongst his peers and by his team and always takes a "can do" approach when working cross functionally. I would highly recommend Lou for any technical or leadership position!</p>

                <p><i>Senior Data Architect</i></p>
                <p>Lou is a gem among gems - exquisitely skilled and adept at software application design and engineering, and equally adept in technology leadership, guiding his teams in successful development and deployments. The morale of his direct reports was as high as I've ever seen and this was due to his light touch as a leader, coupled with his technical prowess. I worked with Lou at Illumina across nearly 4 years of hilarious high tech hijinx. We sat across a cube aisle from each other for a couple years and I still smile at all the times he carefully laid verbal traps that I blindly walked into, to the extreme entertainment of everyone around us. That well-developed humor brightened the days when deadlines or tough slogging were weighing on staff, and I sorely missed it when I migrated to the operations side of the company.

                <p>Lou was the Director of Solutions Architecture and DevOps at Illumina when I first interacted with him as a customer of Rancher. Although we had only met a few times initially, Lou came across highly knowledgeable, technical, and pragmatic in the conversations we had about Rancher. He was so invaluable in his feedback that we quickly invited him to our Rancher Advisory Council to help shape our roadmap. His influence can be widely seen in the development of Rancher throughout the years. Lou has been a joy to work with and definitely a person that you can bounce ideas off of. Highly recommend!</p>
